						  <p class="fs-18 color-ddd">During the period of working together with Asma at JoyBox Company, she proved herself to be a dependable developer and a hard worker with solid problem solving and technical skills. I was always impressed by Asma’s ability to complete the work assigned to her on time.
Asma is a talented, hard-working developer, I strongly recommend Asma for any high-level development position. I have no doubt Asma could excel in an upper-level development position.</p>

						  <p class="fs-18 color-ddd">As a lecturer at the Faculty of Information Technology at Damascus University, I’ve known Miss Asma Hawari as a student in the Artificial Intelligence department. She has been my student in “Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery” course.</p>

<p class="fs-18 color-ddd">Through this course, Asma exhibited, beside her solid background in programming skills and abstraction abilities, her eagerness for the research in AI and NLP domains, and a very sound understanding of research fundamentals with an open mind for continuous learning.</p>

<p class="fs-18 color-ddd">Asma is a very motivated person, hardworking, has a great degree of self-discipline, and has the ability to present her ideas clearly and simply. Thus, I consider her a suitable candidate for a research program.</p>
